# Marked as Spam Outlook flow

Documentation for marking e-mails as Spam using Microsoft Flow.

![Intro](images/intro.png)

## Problem description

Legitimate e-mails are very often moved to Spam (junk) folder and deleted after short period of time (e.g. after two weeks).

## Short solution description

If you don't want to loose important e-mail, it's better to keep e-mails marked as Spam in different folder. It's possible to do that automatically using **Microsoft Flow**.

> **Important:** Solution based on filters (e.g. when new e-mail arrives and "from" contains "@" move e-mail to "Inbox") doesn't work anymore.

## Solution description

New e-mails in "Junk Mail" folder will be automatically moved to separate folder (e.g. "Marked as Spam"). **Microsoft Flow** will be used to achieve that.

>  **Note:** Please consider this method as marking e-mails as Spam (junk). You will be able to delete those e-mails manually.

## Requirements

**Outlook.com** or **Office 365 Outlook** account.

## Limitations

Free **Microsoft Flow** accounts have **750** runs per month. If you need to handle more e-mails marked as Spam, please consider **Microsoft Flow** [paid plan](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/).

## Configuration

> **Important:** If you want to configure "**Office 365 Outlook**", please chose "**Office 365 Outlook**" instead of "**Outlook.com**" in all steps.
